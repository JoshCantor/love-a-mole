Love-a-Mole - A Browser Game
===========================

To complete this assignment you'll be filling out several components of a webapp. Right now the app does nothing, when you've finished it should be a clone of the game Whack-a-Mole. 

Whack-a-Mole is an arcade game where moles appear at random out of a collection of holes. The player then strikes them with a mallet and scores points by whacking as many moles as possible in a limited amount of time. Our game will be played inside of a modern web browser.

To get the game working you will have to complete several missing components of the application. There is missing work in the following files:

```
index.html
styles/whack-a-mole.css
main.js
Mole.js
```

Good luck!
